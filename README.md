# Neon Clock
I read somewhere that little things like this were good starter projects 
that recruiters check out.

## Why
Because I wanted some complete public projects on my GitHub and almost 
everything else I do at home is for internal use at work. This was 
welcome distraction and fitted in to what little spare time I have. 

## What did I learn?
That finishing something is a great feeling but the urge to tinker with it 
never leaves you. That simple things can put a smile on your face and that I 
love the neon glow effect.
